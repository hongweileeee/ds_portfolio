# Lee Hongwei - Data Scientist/Analyst

## About Me
- 👋 Hi, I’m Hongwei
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming, music, sports science, cloud computing and finance. Can't really narrow it down to one, I'm just a very distracted generalist.
- 🌱 I’ve recently completed General Assembly's Data Science Immersive Bootcamp (Completion date: 15-05-2024)
- 🔎 Current interests include topics such as Data Storytelling, Analysis, Computer Vision, Audio AI and NLP
- 💞️ I’m willing to collaborate on any project that requires data analysis/machine learning

## Projects
### (Nike Zoom Ally - An Overstriding Classifier)[https://github.com/hongweileeee/ds_portfolio/tree/main/GA_capstone_Overstride_Classifier]
**Summary:** This project was created as a proof-of-concept for AI feature implementations on Nike's running coach app: Nike Run Club (NRC). To strengthen NRC's position as a trusted virtual running coach, we are proposing to include running form error classifiers. The new feature aims to reduce the injury risks of uncoached running. 

**Key Objectives:** Build an overstriding classifier to be integrated with the currently exisitng Nike Run Club App

**Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, PyTube, Matplotlib, Mediapipe, OpenCV, Tensorflow, Tensorflow.Keras, CNN, LSTM
